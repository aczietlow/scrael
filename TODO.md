# TODO List


* Build a **BASIC** web crawler
    * Stop getting distracted by actually making a working web crawler
* Refactor code to use basic runtime config to change settings more easily.
* Refactor the crawler to support concurrency
* Start writing unit tests.

## Web Crawler

* Pick back up from the miro board as a design of what I was thinking for concurrency
    * Not having access to maps or slices due to being unsafe and causing race conditions is going to be a challenge for future Chris to figure out
